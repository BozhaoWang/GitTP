THis is simple pcg solver program in c++ generated by chatgpt and modified after. 

This objectif of this TP is not to understand the c++.

In fact, in the program, serveral lines were commented. What you need to do is to remove "//" before those lines to let the program output informations.

As there are several files, you can work in groupe (2 personnes) to achieve the efficiency. 

1. One of the teammate forks this repository to his own git private repository.

2. This teammate invite another teammate as a team member to work with him is this project. 

3. After that, each teammate will do a "git clone" to get the private repository to his local repository after done a "git init" in his local repository.

4. Dev A remove the comments in pcg.cpp file to enable print; Dev B remove the comments in main.cpp to enable print.

5. Each Dev commit their modifications 

6. Publish the new code to your remote repository.

You can try to run the code to if it can print something.

To compile to code, you need gcc compile 
	g++ main.cpp pcg.cpp -o a.out

To execute 
	./a.out
